# Cancer Research

This is a collection of research work done under Dr. Ngom at the University of Windsor Computer
Science department. The work is focused on the analysis of many forms of cancer, how to better
diagnose and treat patients. This falls into the realm of bioinformatics, leveraging computer scientists'
knowledge of statistical learning and analysis methods to discover hidden information in publicly
available datasets.


## Usage

Each directory is a self contained, distinct project. Please check the README in the respective folder
for the links to the required datasets. They will not be present in the repo due to the immense file size,
however they are publicly accessible. In some cases, certain datasets may be generated by scripts
I have written. Furthermore, in the R scripts, you must edit the command that sets the working directory,
to reflect the corresponding location *on your computer*.

## Prerequisites

You will need the R compiler and/or RStudio to make use of the R scripts I have written throughout
my work.
